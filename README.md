# AI Legal Analysis Tool

This project demonstrates an advanced AI system for comprehensive legal analysis of complex contracts, built on an agentic framework using AutoGen Studio.

## Overview

Our AI-powered legal analysis tool leverages multiple specialized AI agents to perform in-depth analysis of construction contracts. This approach goes beyond traditional chatbots, offering a sophisticated, multi-step analysis process that thoroughly examines extensive legal documents.

## Key Features

- Utilizes four specialized AI agents: Financial Analyst, Contract Lawyer, Claim Expert, and Risk Manager
- Built on AutoGen Studio, an open-source project by Microsoft Research
- Capable of analyzing complex contracts (e.g., 250 MEUR powerplant construction contract)
- Generates comprehensive legal opinions comparable to human experts

## Setup and Usage

For detailed setup instructions and usage guide, please refer to our [Setup Guide](docs/setup_guide.md) and [Usage Instructions](docs/usage_instructions.md).

## Experiment Replication

We encourage experts and lawyers to examine our results and replicate the experiment. Full configuration files and instructions are provided in this repository.

## Results and Implications

Our experiment demonstrates the potential of AI in handling complex legal tasks traditionally requiring human expertise. For a detailed discussion of our findings and their implications, see our [Experiment Results](docs/experiment_results.md).
